        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Ana Sancho!</h1>
				<br></br>
				<p>I'M A KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER AND TECHNOLOGY EXPLORER</p>
				<p>I'm best known as PHI<em>I Love to solve problems </em> interacting with creative people.
				
	<br></br>
 I Love to learn new technologies and share knowledge in hardware and software - blending design, software and aesthetics emerging from technology. I’m a developer and audio-visual technician studying Computer Science, with knowledge in a wide diversity of technologies and environments. I'M A KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPLORER who feels passionate about solving computational problems and interacting with creative people by exploring appropriate analytical instruments/Design thinking methods.
Growing up in an “age of technology” between Australia and Portugal, I started with the ZX Spectrum or self made/self-taught solutions. I understand the transition of analog to digital.Through the years, I've been continuously developing new techniques in the computational field to share knowledge in hardware/software: Blending design, software or aesthetics emerging from technology-Remain to be themes of Documentaries/Personal Projects. 
Keeping Up With Social Media & future developments, I believe in Continuing Professional Development.
Personal Experience in audiovisual/media market, developed in me the need to explore programming languages besides prototyping, editing/MG. I'm interested in new media technology using VR/AR/MR - exploring possibilities in web development/app-interactive media solutions for new media platforms. Interested in program languages such as C # C++Python & JavaScript - three.js; Open/WebGL - are my goals since late 2016.
Currently, I'm increasing knew perspectives on social/economic sustainable design solutions in the creative fields/market. Focused on marketing strategy/new media interactive platforms,that respond to the users action, such as inter-connectivity systems between text,Kinesics & metacommunication artifact-video/audio in industry or video games.
As a professional my ambition is to connect different areas of knowledge, learn and work within a project team, so that I can develop work progress/value and put into action my knowledge besides exploring future possibilities together with synergy, dynamic, productive creative ways to achieve new perspectives/vision - interacting media as a form of communication. My goal is to Look for new ways of self-improvement and innovation in computer science. </div><!-- /.blurb -->
