        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Ana  <em>PHI</em> Sancho!</h1>
				<br></br>
				<center><p> A KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER AND TECHNOLOGY EXPLORER</p
					
				</center>
				
	<br></br>
I love to learn and share knowledge in hardware and software . You can see me as the person who solves problems by working autonomously and interacting with creative people - blending code and aesthetics emerging from technology. I’m a developer and audio-visual technician, who just started out developing Computer Science and programming skills. I aim to explore a wide diversity of digital technologies and upgrade knowledge in network virtualization environments or hardware components, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. 
I feel passionate about solving computational problems and exploring appropriate analytical instruments/Design thinking methods.

			Growing up in an “age of technology” between Australia and Portugal, I started with the ZX Spectrum or self made/self-taught solutions. Later, at the university of sound and image, It was when I first contacted RaspberryPi and Arduino to create servers, Open Source network platforms and creative projects. So I understand well, the powerful transition of analog to digital.Through the years, I've been continuously developing new techniques in the computational field to share knowledge in hardware/software, which remains to be themes of documentaries/personal projects. 
Keeping up with social media and its future developments and Innovations in digitization, analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation are supercharging performance, and enabling the emergence of new business innovations and new forms of competition.  Technology itself continues to evolve creating performance and productivity opportunities for business and even reshape the way we imagine social network as it interacts with the future. That's why I believe in continuing professional development.
Personal experience in audiovisual/media market, developed in me the need to update programming languages skills, besides prototyping and editing. These last years, I've become interested in new media technology using VR/AR/MR - exploring possibilities in web development/app-interactive media solutions for new media platforms. Interested in program languages such as C # C++Python & JavaScript - three.js; Open/WebGL - are my goals since late 2016.
Currently, I continue researching Computer Vision and Knowledge Representation /DBMS DATABASE. Focused on marketing strategy/new media interactive platforms,that respond to the users action, such as inter-connectivity systems between text,Kinesics & metacommunication artifact-video/audio in industry or video games.
As a professional, my ambition is to connect different areas of knowledge, learn and work within a project team, so that I can develop work progress/value and put into action my knowledge besides exploring future possibilities together with synergy, dynamic, productive creative ways to achieve new perspectives/vision - interacting media as a form of communication. My goal is to Look for new ways of self-improvement and update experience in computer science.</div><!-- /.blurb -->
