        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Ana Sancho!</h1>
				<p>I'm best known as PHI<em>I Love to solve problems </em> interacting with creative people.
					 I'M A KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER AND TECHNOLOGY EXPLORER

I Love to learn new technologies and share knowledge in hardware and software. Blending design, software and aesthetics emerging from technolog ohh
					I’m a developer and audio-visual technician studying Computer Science, with experience in a wide diversity of technologies and environments. Having participated in several of projects I went through experiences of working alone and in large teams. I started the profession of software inspired by the Atari and Spectrum games, and  found that business management was in my blood. A fan of programming languages and a catalyst of nature.
				m. And never tired of learning all that is new. I’m always opened to new challenges. Passionate about technology and stories, curious by nature, grown in business environment, formed in Audio-visual. I find the greatest freedom in the structure of a form that paradoxes abnormality within a norm. I do not focus on specific technologies, I adopt on what is most appropriate in each situation. . Always think outside the box. Open mind with Profound need of knowledge of the market - It opens up new horizons in how I see the world and social/cultural organizations. Concentrated on innovation and evolution of IT, I transit well between strategy/logic and abstract/creative design thinking. I see failure as an opportunity to grow stronger and open new doors of perception/knowledge. Exploring the potential of editing programs. SKetching creative ideas. Using different software platforms. I love helping people, sharing experiences with all those who are starting out in the area and want to collaborate more and more with the IT community as much as I can.<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
